# Portfolio

My name is Mark Nakamae and I graduated from Cal Poly SLO in 2021 with a B.S. degree in Computer Engineering. This repository contains all school-related projects completed during my time at Cal Poly SLO, as well as personal projects I've worked on in my free time. I've organized projects into different classes, with instructions to compile and run each, as well as a brief overhead description of the project itself.
